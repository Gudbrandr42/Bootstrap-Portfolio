        <p>
          Mark Bullard was born in Fayetteville, NC in 1983 to parents Brenda
          and Kenneth Bullard. He has one sibling, Ray Bullard, who is three
          years older than him. Both brothers are US Army Veterans who were
          deployed at the same time during OIF/OEF (Operation Iraqi
          Freedome/Operation Enduring Freedom). Mark entered the service when he
          was 17 years old, in 2001. He completed his service in 2009, prior
          starting his educational path in Instructional Design and Technology.
          He holds a BS, achieved through Walden University, in Instructional
          Design and Technology - with a concentration in Human Factors and
          Interface Design (completed 2013). He spent many years, after his
          service working in various fields using some of the skills taught to
          him in school but his desire was always to become a web developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mark Bullard struggled to find his way into the IT field, at first,
          but was given an opportunity in his current position as a QA Tester.
          Since then, he has learned a variance of abilities in such a short
          time, in order to apply it to his work and start a foundation of
          learning. Enter: UNC Coding Bootcamp. He scrounged up the money to pay
          for the tuition and put his trust in the investment of becoming a Full
          Stack Web Developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          He faces his truest challenge, as he embarks on this journey to
          acheive a dream that has long been just that. With the skills he
          learns here, Mark will update this webpage as it goes along, adding
          his achievements in his portfolio.
